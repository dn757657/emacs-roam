  abstract = {This paper presents a complex and extensive experimental evaluation of fine particle emissions released by an FDM 3D printer for four of the most common printing materials (ABS, PLA, PET-G, and TPU). These thermoplastic filaments were examined at three printing temperatures within their recommended range. In addition, these measurements were extended using various types of printing nozzles, which influenced the emissions considerably. This research is based on more than a hundred individual measurements for which a standardized printing method was developed. The study presents information about differences between particular printing conditions in terms of the amount of fine particles emitted as well as the particle size distributions during printing periods. This expands existing knowledge about the emission of ultrafine particles during 3D printing, and it can help reduce the emissions of these devices to achieve cleaner and safer 3D printer operations.},

  abstract = {Particle emissions from multiple fused deposition modeling consumer 3D printers were systematically quantified utilizing an established emission testing protocol (Blue Angel) to allow quantitative exposure assessments for printers operating in different environments. The data are consistent with particle generation from volatilization of the polymer filament as it is heated by the extruder. Typically, as printing begins, a burst of new particle formation leads to the smallest sizes and maximum number concentrations produced throughout the print job. For acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) filaments, instantaneous concentrations were up to 106 \#/cm3 with mean particle sizes of 20 to 40 nm when measured in a well mixed 1 m3 chamber with 1 air change per hour. Particles are continuously formed during printing and the size distribution evolves consistent with vapor condensation and particle coagulation. Particles emitted per mass of filament consumed (particle yield) varied widely due to factors including printer brand, and type and brand of filament. Higher extruder temperatures result in larger emissions. For filament materials tested, average particle number yields ranged from 7.3 × 108 to 5.2 × 1010 g−1 (approximately 0.65 to 24 ppm), with trace additives apparently driving the large variations. Nanoparticles (diameters less than 100 nm) dominate number distributions, whereas diameters in the range of 200 to 500 nm contribute most to estimated mass. Because 3D printers are often used in public spaces and personal residences, the general public and particularly susceptible populations, such as children, can be exposed to high concentrations of non-engineered nanoparticles of potential toxicity.Copyright © 2017 American Association for Aerosol Research},

  abstract = {Consumer-level 3D printers emit ultrafine and fine particles, though little is known about their chemical composition or potential toxicity. We report chemical characteristics of the particles in comparison to raw filaments and assessments of particle toxicity. Particles emitted from polylactic acid (PLA) appeared to be largely composed of the bulk filament material with mass spectra similar to the PLA monomer spectra. Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS), extruded at a higher temperature than PLA, emitted vastly more particles and their composition differed from that of the bulk filament, suggesting that trace additives may control particle formation. In vitro cellular assays and in vivo mice exposure all showed toxic responses when exposed to PLA and ABS-emitted particles, where PLA-emitted particles elicited higher response levels than ABS-emitted particles at comparable mass doses. A chemical assay widely used in ambient air-quality studies showed that particles from various filament materials had comparable particle oxidative potentials, slightly lower than those of ambient particulate matter (PM2.5). However, particle emissions from ABS filaments are likely more detrimental when considering overall exposure due to much higher emissions. Our results suggest that 3D printer particle emissions are not benign and exposures should be minimized.},
