** Hot Ends
| Printer | Hot End    | Max Temp. | Responsiveness/Material | Power | Options              |
|---------+------------+-----------+-------------------------+-------+----------------------|
| Prusa   | E3D V6     | 300C      | Alu Copper              | 30W   | up to 500C w/upgrade |
| Ender   | Sprite Pro | 300C      | Alu                     | n/a   | n/a                  |
| Pulse   | E3D V6     | 300C      | Alu Copper              | 30W   | up to 500C w/upgrade |
|         |            |           |                         |       |                      |

- heater materials are kind of ambiguous/not much information provided, can only assume that the copper alloy is going to be more responsive in terms of dissapating and transferring heat
- Ender can be upgraded to E3D V6
- just from breif googling E3D has much better documentation

** Extruder
| Printer | Drive  | Weight |
| Prusa   | Dircet |        |
| Ender   | Direct |        |
| Pulse   | Bowden |        |

- weight can contribute to overshoot/ringing/ is generally bad
- TPU and other flexible filaments can be printed using a bowden setup but not easily, dirct drive certainly much better

** Other
| Printer | Levelling Sensor       | Documentation/Support | Community | Max Bed Temp | Printing Speed |
|---------+------------------------+-----------------------+-----------+--------------+----------------|
| Prusa   | Inductive (pinda)      | Good                  | Large     | 120C         | 80 mm/s        |
| Ender   | Hall Effect (CR Touch) | Not Great             | Large     | 110 C        | 60 mm/s        |
| Pulse   | Hall Effect (BL Touch) | Exists                | Exists    | 115 C        | 60 mm/s        |
|         |                        |                       |           |              |                |

- hall effect levelling sensor may be a must with garolite printing bed and TPU adhesion, induction sensor still works but added bed thickness (above metal bottom) is limited

** Slicers
- all slicers seem to be based on the same CUSA engine and are all open source
- any slicer, since it is onyl producing G-CODE can be modified via code langauge of choice post process
- Prusa slicer features preloaded presets for materials, etc, this is not seen as valuable in this instance as the project is using custom materials and possible slicer modificaitons

** Motion
- prusa is considered more accurate motion system, especially for small parts
- prusa uses better bearings and not rubber wheels like ender

** Motherboard/Computing
- both prusa and pulse are 8-bit, where ender is 32-bit

* Risks

** Venting
- venting is required for most printing filaments
- nothing crazy usually a fan out the window or similar
- highly ventilated room is also acceptbable

*** Materials
- nylon (Caverna)
- abs
- TPU (varioshore)

** Hardware

*** levelling
- avoid inductive type leveling sensors as only works with metal bed materials, may not be suitable for filaments in mind [[id:85a8da31-132f-4bb3-83bd-46749b9997bf][leveling sensors]] 

** Misc
- delivery
- ender hot end may not be responssive enough given aluminum only heating block
- availability of correct bed surfaces for TPU adhesion, can also use glues on normal or glass beds
- varioshore STARTS foaming at 230C, will 300C be enough to fully observe its properties?

* Important params
- hot end control and response - titanium for ender both up to 300 degreesC
- motion accuracy - prusa big advantage rubber vs solid and bedding
- extruder both good but prusa not metla
- prusa much higher motherbord - prusa may strruggle with tough g code
- stepper drivers similar support sensorless homing only on prusa
- prusa lightweight bed and auto level same bed on ender but manual levelling 110 deg ender vs 120 deg prusa
- prusa best levelling sensor
- ender has some dumb extras like lights
- 
- prua much more accurate
- both can extrude the same filaments
- prusa 80mm/min, 60mm/min for ender
- 
- prusa has much better software/firmware
- prusa specific slicer
- 
- prusa wins big on documentation
